Rental Market Trends in Germany: Apartments dominate the rental market, accounting for 55.9% of rented flats. Maisonettes and ground floor units follow closely in demand. Understanding the preferences for different types of flats is crucial for real estate professionals and investors.

Average Rent Prices Across German States vary significantly. For instance, in Hamburg, the average rent is approximately €1,220, while in Sachsen-Anhalt, it's the lowest at around €490. These figures hold relevance for immigrants and expanding companies looking for suitable accommodation options.
